almost 4 years.Belonging to 2016-2020 batch and being in the final year with spending ample
amount of time in GRIET-AAC, I understand AAC as “Interdisciplinary Research Centre”.
Leadership, Patience and Creativity would define my strengths that I developed during my
course in the last 3 years. Having this attitude, I have remained successful in bringing together a
team which is efficient enough and has adequate knowledge to work with the new scientific
upcoming courses like IoT , Machine Learning and Deep Learning, till date.
I firmly believe that I have been a successful mentor to my fellow juniors in assist them in all
ways possible. Along with having an impressive academic record, I have maintained tabs on all
the crucial changes related to political and environmental fields that have come up in the
society, so far.
The ultimate goal I’m currently striving towards is to make the world a better place to live in, with
new advancements in technology. And to begin with I am aiming to serve in the Civil Services
as my next step towards achieving my ultimate goal. I feel and believe at the same time that I
can do much more for the society.
As of now, I am handling a project on a self-driven car which runs on Image processing and
Machine learning. I love exploring the latest scientific inventions in the field of AI/ML and I do
spend a lot of time reading and researching for the same. On another note, I am a fitness freak
and I enjoy watching movies. However, I consider that the qualities I possess and developed
over my course here, have enhanced my personality both personally and professionally. I am
really grateful and feel responsible with a desire to study with endorsements from my parents
and beloved ones.</p>
