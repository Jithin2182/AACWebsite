			"Research paper." What image comes into mind as you hear those words: working with stacks of articles and
			books, hunting the "treasure" of others' thoughts? Whatever image you create, it's a sure bet that you're
			envisioning sources of information--articles, books, people, and artworks. Yet a research paper is more than
			the sum of your sources, more than a collection of different pieces of information about a topic, and more
			than a review of the literature in a field. A research paper analyzes a perspective or argues a point.
			Regardless of the type of research paper you are writing, your finished research paper should present your
			own thinking backed up by others' ideas and information. </p>

				In specific, sitting in wrong posture for persistent period of time results in many health problems such

			<h class="detail_des_h">Abstract:</h>
			<p class="detail_des_p sub">In the post segmentation scenario, when objects in the scene have been
				extracted, the focus shifts to object identification. This can be achieved through shape or texture.
				Finding the object boundary has been a reliable means of shape description. Among the mathematical
				approximation techniques for shape analysis, Fourier descriptors have proven to approximate closed
				boundaries of objects quite well, albeit with some limitations. A statistical thresholding technique to
				restrict the number of descriptors for a reasonably good approximation of the target shape is explored
				and tested on some medical images. Encouraging results were obtained particularly when segmentation in
				the preprocessing stage was effectively carried out.</p>

			<h class="detail_des_h">Abstract:</h>
			<p class="detail_des_p sub">Matters like prescription and maintenance of health records hugely impact the
				efficiency of health care. Advanced technologies could be used to change the current scenario. This
				paper proposes a resourceful, web interface which enables access of medical records to the patients and
				a neural network model which predicts medication for ailments. The web interface acts as a medium
				between doctor and patient, allowing them to access the required information. The proposed method uses
				custom trained speech to text model and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the acquired text,
				to provide the patient with a prescription. The proposed method further develops a neural network model
				which predicts the medication to be used by the patient, based on the symptoms. The proposed system
				achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 21.5% for the custom trained Speech to Text (STT) model. The AI bot
				used for medication prediction has achieved an accuracy of 88%.</p>

			<p class="detail_des_p sub p_title">On Efficient Shape Retrieval Of Systematic Curves Using Fourier

			</p>



			<h class="detail_des_h">Abstract:</h>
			<p class="detail_des_p sub">Summarizing complex boundary shapes can be challenging. Approximation tools that
				already exist may require tweaking and refinement or novel approximation techniques need to be designed
				and tested for robustness. The problems arising in contexts like biological, satellite and medical
				imagery pose several challenging problems where object recognition becomes the focus of study. One of
				the means of recognizing objects is to describe their shapes. Boundary description is one of the means
				of summarizing shapes. Adding texture and color analysis to boundary is expected to take us closer to
				object recognition and understanding. Boundary of a shape can be modelled by spatial methods or through
				spectral approaches. Bilateral and radial symmetries are the popular areas of study. Since symmetry
				holds high level structural information, a study of symmetries can aid high level processing goals like
				segmentation and template matching to mention a few. The effectiveness of a near exact or exact
				reproduction of shape can be used for studying a variety of biological situations including leaf shape
				analysis and study of human parts. We focus on some shapes having bilateral symmetry, synthetic in
				nature, and try to retrieve a fair approximation using Fourier descriptors. We hope to extend this
				approach to some real-world problems where symmetries are observed. Three well known shape signatures
				viz. the centroid distance, area and cumulative angular functions are considered in this study. The
				performance of the cumulative angular function has been observed to be superior. This was tested on some
				shapes having bilateral symmetry and test results justify our findings.</p>

			<p class="detail_des_p sub p_title">A two way communication system with Morse code Medium for people with
				Multiple
				Disabilities

			</p>



			<h class="detail_des_h">Abstract:</h>
			<p class="detail_des_p sub">This paper proposes an innovative, Morse code based two-way communication system
				with four user-accessible modes. The four modes are determined to provide speech to Morse vibrations and
				Morse to speech conversion. The proposed system is embedded with touch, gesture, vibration, microphone,
				and speaker modules coupled with a microprocessing unit. An S-Morse dictionary convert Morse code
				pattern read from the touch sensor to voice and speech from microphone to Morse vibration. A gesture
				recognition model using the SVM algorithm is implemented for the selection of user-accessible modes. The
				system modes also send and receive text data from an android application through a cloud network. The
				received and sent data will be converted into vibrations of Morse code pattern and voice forms
				respectively. The proposed method is strengthened by validating Morse conversion, machine learning
				algorithm accuracy, gesture recognition accuracy, Morse time analysis for alphabets, word and gesture
				analysis for mode selection.</p>

			<h class="detail_des_h">Abstract:</h>
			<p class="detail_des_p sub">Data in IT systems in enterprises have been growing at phenomenal pace. This has
				provided opportunities to run analytics to gather intelligence on key business parameters that enable
				them to provide better products and services to customers. While there are several Artificial
				Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Business Intelligence (BI) tools and technologies available in
				marketplace to run analytics, there is a need for an integrated view when developing intelligent
				solutions in enterprises. This paper progressively elaborates a reference model for enterprise
				solutions, builds an integrated view of data, information and intelligence components and presents a
				reference architecture for intelligent enterprise solutions. Finally, it applies the reference
				architecture to an insurance organization. The reference architecture is the outcome of experience and
				insights gathered from developing intelligent solutions for several organizations.</p>
