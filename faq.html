                <p class="detail_des_p" >Peer-to-peer learning is fast, free and fun. Teaching peers is one of the best ways to develop mastery "It is a kind of educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals."Peer learning is where a student’s research, gather information and then share it with his fellow learner. It facilitates his learning and also that of his peers. The main benefits of peer teaching include, but are not limited to, the following: Students receive more time for individualized learning, direct interaction between students promotes active learning, and peer teachers reinforce their own learning by instructing others, students feel more comfortable and open when interacting with their fellow learner, peers and students share a similar discourse, allowing for greater understanding. 
This mean of teaching is a financially efficient alternative to hiring more staff members. Teachers receive more time to focus on the next lesson.
 Certain research indicates that peer learning activities typically yield the following results for both tutor and tutee: team-building and better relationships; greater psychological well-being, social competence, communication skills and self-esteem, higher achievement and greater productivity in terms of enhanced learning outcomes.
Peer learning goes with the adage 'In learning you will teach and in teaching you will learn'.
