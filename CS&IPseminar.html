              The Institute of Engineers (India), Telangana State Centre has
              organised a two day All India Seminar on ‘Cyber Security and Image
              Processing” on 10th and 11th August. The event was inaugurated by
              our Hon’ble Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Govt. of
              India, Shri G. Kishan Reddy and the Guest-of-Honour for the
              seminar was Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad City, Govt. of
              Telangana, Shri Anjani kumar, IPS. The inaugural started with
              National Song VANDEMATARAM and a Welcome speech by Dr. G.
              Rameshwar Rao, FIE, Chairman Institute of Engineers India (IEI),
              TSC. Dr. K.M.M. Rao, Chairman, Technical Committee, Senior Member
              and Former Director ISRO Hyderabad described about the Seminar.
              Later, Dr. B. Sriram, Chief Executive Officer, Cyber Security
              Centre for Excellence, DSCI, New Delhi addressed the key note
              which was followed by a short address by Guest-of-Honour about the
              importance of and need of cyber security by sharing an incident
              which happened in Newyork in which a famous business tycoon died
              suddenly due to poisoning, this happened because of the diabetes
              pump which was implanted in the victim's body was hacked and made
              to release overdose than required, during his speech Anjani Sir
              gave an assertion that "Everything that is connected to the
              internet can be hacked", so one must be aware while surfing the
              net. Subsequently, Union Minister G Kishan Reddy Sir said safety
              and security of the citizens is the top priority of the Central
              government. Also he added cyber technology is being used in border
              safety in many areas as we cannot deploy personnel to keep a vigil
              in the areas like hills and rivers. Central government is also
              looking forward to expand cyber security at all border lines.
              Kishan Reddy congratulated the Warangal police for their efforts
              in delivering light-speed justice in the case of nine-month-old
              infant rape case. Also Read - CM KCR, Nagari MLA Roja offers

              Warangal Police has used technology like CCTV footages to acquire
              evidence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi always advises us to be
              careful while speaking with others even though they might be
              friends, as there is a chance of recording while you speak. The
              increased technology is both a boon and bane, so one must know to
              what extent we have to use technology, he said. Commissioner
              Anjani Kumar said our society has moved from cycle patrolling to
              cyber patrol. Cyber security helps police in detecting crime in
              short span of time and nab the offender. MLC and BJP leader N
              Ramchander Rao, while speaking on the occasion said that once in
              the past even, he was a victim of cyber offence in which he lost
              Rs 34,000 from his bank. Science made human life pleasurable and
              miserable, he added. Kishan Reddy urged the cyber experts who
              attended the seminar to present a report and positive suggestions
              to the central government, so the government could be able to
              improve its developmental activities in the cyber security.The
              inaugural ceremony ended by a Vote of Thanks by Er T Anjaiah, FIE
              Hon. Secretary, IEI, TSC followed by National Anthem JANA GANA
              MANA.

            <p>
              After the inaugural ceremony around 20 invited speakers from gamut
              of areas like space, defence , banking technology, IT Police ,
              Cyber Security, Industry and Universities have delivered invited
              talks. On the whole all the speakers, provided a common platform
              for experts to discuss and deliberate on the issues related to
              topics like Image processing for cyber Security, Image and video
              transmission , Steganography, Visual Cryptography, Cyber Security
              and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comprehensively the seminar gave a knowledge, that visual
              cryptography involves the segmentation of information into
              mutually exclusive and individually random looking components and
              sending them over different paths . The advantage is, if even one
              of the transmission is intercepted it cannot reveal any
              information. This is especially important because it is feared
              that with the advent of Quantum Computing and computational
              complexity alone cannot provide security. Hence it is important to
              ensure that the database is not tampered.
            </p>

            <p>
              The seminar enabled concerned engineers and scientists and the
              budding engineers to gain knowledge on various aspects of the
              Electronics Industry in general and new economic options available
              for practical implementation at all levels in the fields of Cyber
              Security, Image Processing and Internet of Hidden Things(TOR
              Implementation in IoT) also after every talk 10 to 15 mins was
              given to discuss about the information given in the talk where
              doubts were also clarified by speakers understandably.
